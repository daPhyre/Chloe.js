== COJSGE: Canvas Open JavaScript Game Engine ==

Based on http://code.google.com/p/kojage/

COSJGE is intended to be a practical easy-to-use code for developing HTML5 games with the use of Canvas and JavaScript.

This is still an experimental JavaScript code, which can and may change radically. Future versions are not promised to be compatible with the current one.

The code included is:
	cojsge.js 		- The engine
	cursor.png 		- Personal cursor for on canvas display
	example1.html 	- An example (visual)
	example1.js 	- An example (source)
	media 			- A folder containing all the media needed for the example

# COJSGE: Canvas Open JavaScript Game Engine #

Based on http://code.google.com/p/kojage/

COJSGE is intended to be a practical easy-to-use code for developing HTML5 games with the use of Canvas and JavaScript.

Since COJSGE 0.9, the engine focuses on full support for both desktop and mobile HTML5 games.

This is still an experimental JavaScript code, which can and may change radically. Future versions are not promised to be compatible with the current one.

The code included is:
 * reference.md		- All about the project, and how to use it
 * cojsge.js 		- The engine
 * cojsge.jsz 		- The engine, compressed in gzip format (See reference for use)
 * cojsge_defs.js 	- Some constant definitions to make COJSGE easier to use
 * cursor.png 		- Personalizable cursor for on canvas display (You can replace it)
 * cojsge.png		- The project logo
 * example1.html 	- An example (visual)
 * example1.js 		- An example (source)
 * media 			- A folder containing all the media needed for the example

In example1.js, you can switch the comments in line 142 for line 143 and in line 193 for 194 to explore fun effects.
